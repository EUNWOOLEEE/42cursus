# ft_printf
Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough

## Summary
The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf().  
You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that??  
It is actually pretty cool :)

## Usage
```sh
make         # comfile mandatory functions
make clean   # remove temporary files
make fclean  # remove all files
make re      # make fclean and make
```
